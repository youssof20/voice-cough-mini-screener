- **Students** learning audio signal processing and DSP fundamentals
- **Researchers** exploring biomedical signal analysis applications  
- **Developers** building audio analysis tools with real data
- **Engineers** understanding voice/cough analysis techniques

### Key Features

- **Real Feature Extraction**: Pitch, energy, spectral, and stability metrics using DSP
- **Scientific Visualizations**: Waveforms, spectrograms, and pitch contours
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Built with Streamlit for easy use
- **Real Medical Data**: Actual audio samples from Coswara dataset
- **Educational Content**: Detailed explanations of DSP techniques

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone or download** this repository
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Process real data** (if you have Coswara dataset):
   ```bash
   python utils/data_integration.py --process-coswara
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:8501`

### First Time Setup

The application uses **real audio samples** from the Coswara medical dataset. You can also upload your own audio files (WAV, MP3, M4A formats supported).

## üìä Features Extracted

### Pitch Features
- **Mean Pitch (F0)**: Fundamental frequency of voice (Hz)
- **Pitch Standard Deviation**: Variation in pitch over time
- **Jitter Approximation**: Micro-variations in pitch (voice stability indicator)

### Energy Features  
- **RMS Energy**: Root mean square amplitude (loudness)
- **Peak Amplitude**: Maximum volume level
- **Shimmer Approximation**: Micro-variations in amplitude

### Spectral Features
- **Spectral Centroid**: "Brightness" of sound (center of mass of spectrum)
- **Spectral Rolloff**: Frequency below which 85% of energy lies
- **Zero Crossing Rate**: Rate of sign changes (voice vs noise indicator)
- **Spectral Bandwidth**: Width of spectrum around centroid

## üî¨ Technical Implementation

### Audio Processing Pipeline

1. **Audio Loading**: Uses librosa for robust audio file handling
2. **Preprocessing**: Resampling to 22,050 Hz (standard for speech analysis)
3. **Feature Extraction**: Frame-based analysis with 1024-sample windows
4. **Pitch Tracking**: librosa's piptrack algorithm (50-400 Hz range)
5. **Spectral Analysis**: 2048-point FFT with 512-sample hop length
6. **Visualization**: matplotlib for scientific-quality plots

### Risk Score Calculation

The "Health Risk Indicator" is a **demonstration metric only** that combines:
- Jitter and shimmer variations (voice stability)
- Pitch variability (neurological indicators)  
- Energy levels (respiratory strength)
- Spectral characteristics (voice quality)

**This score has no clinical validity and is purely educational.**

## üéµ Demo Samples

The application includes three pre-generated synthetic samples:

1. **Normal Voice** (`demo_voice.wav`): Simulated speech with harmonics
2. **Cough Sample** (`demo_cough.wav`): Simulated cough with frequency sweeps
3. **Breathy Voice** (`demo_breathy_voice.wav`): Simulated breathy speech

These samples are programmatically generated and contain no copyrighted material.

### üéØ Adding Real Data (Recommended)

For more accurate demonstrations, integrate real voice and cough datasets:

#### Quick Setup:
```bash
# 1. Set up data directories
python setup_real_data.py

# 2. Download COUGHVID dataset (recommended)
# Visit: https://coughvid.epfl.ch/
# Extract to: data/coughvid/

# 3. Process the dataset
python utils/data_integration.py --process-coughvid

# 4. Start the app - real samples will appear in sidebar
streamlit run app.py
```
